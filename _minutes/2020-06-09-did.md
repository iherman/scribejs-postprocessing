**Brent Zundel:** agenda for today = next topic call, feature freeze, extended discussions, straw poll resolution about publishing first public WG note of registries, jump into core issues  
… any agenda bashing?  
… hearing none we move on. Introductions.  

### 1. (Re-)introductions
{: #section1}

**Brent Zundel:** re-introducing yancy  

> *Yancy Ribbens:* sorry my audio is on the fritz

**Yancy Ribbens:** ... (maybe no audio but here in spirit)  

**Brent Zundel:** re-introducing rhiaro who also has no audio  

### 2. Topic call
{: #section2}

**Brent Zundel:** next topic call is coming up; focused on resolution contracts; th 6/11 @ noon EDT  
… please join us, we want to wrap things up  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/labels/contract](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/labels/contract)

**Brent Zundel:** there's momentum, see existing pull requests  

**Manu Sporny:** is justin able to process proposed changes to merge in?  

**Justin Richer:** maybe 🤷‍♀️  

### 3. Feature Freeze
{: #section3}

**Brent Zundel:** feature freeze ❄️. It means "no more substantive changes, no more big ideas, we have everything we want"  
… we have already passed our original deadline but we're still working towards it.  
… if you have something you want to add, do it now, because we're going to feature freeze in the next month or so  
… otherwise we'll never get this done  

**Daniel Burnett:** "month or so" actually means "next few weeks"  
… realistically this is right before fake/virtual F2F discussions  
… we haven't seen "new stuff" rolling in in general. bug fixes and repair are ok  
… if you think something major is missing get it in now  

**Justin Richer:** Point of clarity on feature freeze, is that for things that are already incorporated into the spec at that point, or are outstanding discussions about things that we may or may not want in the spec will continue?  

**Brent Zundel:** It's more "Let's not bring up anything new"  

### 4. Extended discussion time, a.k.a. "Fake F2F"
{: #section4}

**Brent Zundel:** next topic is extended discussion time -- "fake F2F"  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://doodle.com/poll/9gr3824w5p3qxs3e](https://doodle.com/poll/9gr3824w5p3qxs3e)

**Brent Zundel:** it won't be face to face but will be excellent™️  
… please fill out the poll, it lets you indicate availability during the selected week (in 3.5h blocks). Chairs will check it Friday morning (7am mountain time US)  
… please pretend that you're actually traveling and skip your regular meetings to attend this  
… going to have 2 or 3 blocks of 3.5h each over 2 or 3 days. Hoping to find times that work for all three time regions (US/EU/APAC)  

### 5. Publishing registries document as a FPWD Note
{: #section5}

**Brent Zundel:** time to put forth a proposal about DID registries document. it's a NOTE  
… proposing that we will publish our first public Working Draft. does not indicate any consensus at all. Doesn't even mean we like it.  

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/FPWD/2020-06-18/](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/FPWD/2020-06-18/)

**Brent Zundel:** it means "here's a thing and it's probably worth looking at"  

> **Proposed resolution: The DID WG will publish a FPWD Note of the DID Specification Registries document, using the short name did-spec-reg, and use echidna to update the note as PRs are merged.** *(Brent Zundel)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Amy Guy:* +1, but did-spec-registries better

> **Proposed resolution: The DID WG will publish a FPWD Note of the DID Specification Registries document, using the short name did-spec-registries, and use echidna to update the note as PRs are merged.** *(Brent Zundel)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Manu Sporny:** what's the reason to did-spec-reg instead of did-spec-registries?  

**Brent Zundel:** that's what I typed, will amend proposal  

**Michael Jones:** for all the reasons we talked about on the special topic calls, we should just use "did registries" rather than "did spec registries"  

> *Daniel Burnett:* let's please not rename

> *Drummond Reed:* We had consensus on the name "DID Specification Registries"

**Manu Sporny:** that is not where we had consensus. we specifically put that to the group and decided not to. consensus was on "did spec registries"  

> *Justin Richer:* +1 that was the consensus

**Michael Jones:** why this proposal?  

**Daniel Burnett:** brent mistyped  

**Michael Jones:** comment withdrawn  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Amy Guy:* +1

> *Orie Steele:* +1

> *Markus Sabadello:* +1

> *Dave Longley:* +1

> *Eugeniu Rusu:* +1

> *Daniel Burnett:* +1

> *Justin Richer:* +1

> *Manu Sporny:* +1

> *Drummond Reed:* +1

> *Brent Zundel:* +1

> *Michael Jones:* +1

> *Adrian Gropper:* +1

> ***Resolution #1: The DID WG will publish a FPWD Note of the DID Specification Registries document, using the short name did-spec-registries, and use echidna to update the note as PRs are merged.***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Brent Zundel:** We are resolved. that feels good.  
… we got through that in record time so we have lots of time for issue status check  

### 6. Core issues
{: #section6}

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc)

**Brent Zundel:** these are our issues in the order that we most recently looked at them  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/85](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/85)

**Brent Zundel:** syntactically differentiate data about the did, assigned to selfissued  

**Michael Jones:** i think we need to have a call where we discuss this  
… this is an important thing to solve before feature freeze  

> *Amy Guy:* justin_r: i don't think it necessarily does, but this conversation is going to follow on from the functional contracts conversation because one of the big purposes of that in the core spec is to create an actual notion of what this metadata stuff is

> *Manu Sporny:* 

> *Amy Guy:* ... so we have a way to talk about it which we don't in the core spec right now

> *Amy Guy:* ... [missed a bit] we need to define as a thing first

> *Amy Guy:* ... if you take the full set of PRs, 299, that covers that

> *Amy Guy:* ... I will add a link to the new PR as well

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/75](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/75)

> *Dave Longley:* This duplicates issue 14 -- comment regarding a PR at the end: [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/14#issuecomment-637657441](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/14#issuecomment-637657441)

> *Dave Longley:* I will put that into the issue

**Daniel Buchner:** feels like issue 14 is the bigger issue and we shouldn't define revocation  
… we should just not do this and close it  
… dlongley will add comments to the issue  

**Michael Jones:** I had written a pull request to disallow revoked keys  

**Manu Sporny:** it was merged  

> *Daniel Buchner:* If that was merged, then we can close both

> *Daniel Buchner:* agree

**Michael Jones:** I think we should close this on the basis of this PR, need PR # to make that comment in the issue  

> *Dave Longley:* this PR (https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/308) follows on from [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/279](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/279)

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/261](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/261)

**Brent Zundel:** definition of "client" in regard to SSI principles  
… [?] is not on the call, kyle and drummond are working on it  
… is anyone in the WG willing to accept assignment?  

**Markus Sabadello:** will take it, it's related to resolution  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/259](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/259)

**Brent Zundel:** DIDs and JOSE public keys, assigned to Orie  

**Orie Steele:** we can potentially close this issue, my understanding is that the 'kid' can be anything, this WG doesn't want to add specific language  
… about using 'kid' as the fragment  
… not seeing a ton of desire to do anything with it  

**Manu Sporny:** we have text today that it's recommended kid values are set to public key fingerprint; we do put normative stuff on kid and how ID property is a compound key  
… issue is resolved because group put normative text in  
… will add that as a comment, does Orie agree for closing the issue?  

**Orie Steele:** yes, makes sense  

**Oliver Terbu:** to clarify, this is only about the 'kid' in the JWK? or is this also about external JWT/JWS and providing external 'kid'?  

**Manu Sporny:** yes that's fine  
… you can still point to an external key from the did document  

**Brent Zundel:** this is not discussion time, this is status check  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/185](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/185)

**Brent Zundel:** next issue 185, supported cyphers  
… raised by tobias  
… who is not on the call  

> *Brent Zundel:* acl Orie

**Orie Steele:** most of the use cases we discuss are about signatures and this is about encryption keys; there are a couple ways of doing this and there's desire to have them in the DID documents; we want consensus as to how to do that  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/203](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/203)

**Brent Zundel:** 203, define did document metadata  

**Justin Richer:** no update until we finish the contracts.  

> *Amy Guy:* justin_r: we need a place to talk about metadata before we define any metadata

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/269](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/269)

**Brent Zundel:** 269, good conversation, but they're not on the call  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/151](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/151)

**Brent Zundel:** 151, include discussion of levels of assurance  

**Markus Sabadello:** add discussion about eidas identities and how to link DIDs to them; not discussion about specific frameworks but about linking to a framework in general  

> *Brent Zundel:* link to proposed steps: [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/151#issuecomment-603932879](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/151#issuecomment-603932879)

**Brent Zundel:** is it worthwhile to split this issue or keep this one open?  

**Markus Sabadello:** still valuable to keep it there but need to see if it splits  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/204](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/204)

**Brent Zundel:** 204 define terminology for properties and values  

**Ivan Herman:** there's a resolution to use VC terminology in our spec as well  

> *Drummond Reed:* I remember that same conclusion.

**Brent Zundel:** "chairs have decided this is what we're going to do"  

> *Amy Guy:* justin_r: my understanding was that what we had decided was an augmentation of what's in vcs to state that we have things called properties, those properties have names and values

> *Amy Guy:* ... i've seen that language applied to new PRs but not seen it back through the rest of the document

> *Amy Guy:* ... I don't think we're entirely consistent yet

> *Manu Sporny:* agree that we're not consistent yet, need to do PRs to ensure consistency

> *Amy Guy:* ... we had decided what to do but we need to make sure we're doing it everywhere

> *Drummond Reed:* Agree that we need to consistently use "properties" that have "names" and "values".

> *Amy Guy:* ^^

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/248](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/248)

**Brent Zundel:** 248, new term for relying party  

> *Drummond Reed:* "verifier"

**Phil Archer:** this is holding up the use case document; is there a term the group is happy with for whatever this thing is that some people call "Relying Party"; if so we'll use that  

**Brent Zundel:** let's go bikeshed  
… rough consensus within issue is "Requesting Party"  

**Phil Archer:** have already written a PR with "requesting party", need to account for other views  
… (PR is for use case document not core)  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/65](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/65)

**Brent Zundel:** 65, does did document metadata belong in the document?  

**Markus Sabadello:** current status is similar to others (203), should be addressed by resolution contract PR's that include metadata  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/274](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/274)

**Brent Zundel:** 274, ambiguity around necessity of top-level stuff  

**Daniel Buchner:** should we add direction for @base in JSONLD? need to look at top-level IDs  

**Brent Zundel:** 258, list of early implementations  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/258](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/258)

**Brent Zundel:** anyone willing to move it forward?  

**Manu Sporny:** will take it  

> *Markus Sabadello:* I'll assign myself too if that's okay

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/273](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/273)

**Brent Zundel:** 273, invert mapping between proof purpose and verification methods  

**Drummond Reed:** no update, daniel was the lead, need to talk to him  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/249](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/249)

**Brent Zundel:** 249, mitigating single source of failure in universal resolver  

**Markus Sabadello:** haven't looked recently, have talked with carsten, definitely broader than just universal resolver; has been extensively discussed in did resolution calls  
… have some of this in the resolution PR's  

**Daniel Burnett:** we are now in issues from less than a month ago  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/165](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/165)

**Brent Zundel:** 165, what are entityship and start-of- authority  

**Michael Jones:** will write the PR  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/170](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/170)

**Brent Zundel:** 170, public key IDs  
… duplicate JWK fields  

**Michael Jones:** we agreed to have a special call  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/240](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/240)

**Brent Zundel:** 240, should did core restrict JWKs  

**Manu Sporny:** needs a special topic call  

**Brent Zundel:** is this the same as the last issue, or should we have separate calls?  

**Manu Sporny:** agreed  

**Michael Jones:** if there's time...  

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/36](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/36)
